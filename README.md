# GMIT_52167_2018_Project
Problem statement
The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. The project
entails you researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the
Python programming language [1] based on that research.
An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people
have investigated and written about it previously, and many of those are not experienced
programmers. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks
that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. You
might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

Fisher's Iris Data Set

In a 1936 paper titled 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' biologist and 
statistician Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris flower data set. This is an example of a 
multivariate data set and has been used extensively in the field of data analytics.
This data set gives the measurments in centimetres of sepal width, sepal length, petal width 
and petal length of three variants of iris flowers (setosa, veriscolor and virginica). There 
are 50 samples of each flower totalling 150 entries in the entire data set.
